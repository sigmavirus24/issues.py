# Configuration Management

The configuration file will be managed by python's ConfigParser module. Because
of this decision, it should basically break down into two sections (more can be
added later):

  * Authentication
  * Projects

## Authentication

The authentication section should look like this:

```
[Authentication]
user = sigmavirus24
pass = fakepassword1234567890
```

## Projects

Because each 'option' can only have one value (which makes sense to be honest),
there needs to be a way to manage the projects that are being watched. My first
thought would be to do something like:

```
[Projects]
Todo.txt-python = sigmavirus24
issues.py = sigmavirus24
clint = kennethreitz
fabric = fabric
```
